Project goal: Develop 3 classifiers to predict potential breast cancer using our dataset. 
Classifiers used were: 
-Neural Network Model 
-Logistic Regression Model
-Support Vector Machine Model 

We compared the accuracy of the three classifiers because we believe weâ€™ll find some good inferences from these models from our dataset.
