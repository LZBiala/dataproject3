Project goal: Develop 2 classifiers to predict potential breast cancer using our dataset. One classifier using a Neural Network Model and another classifier using a Logistic Regression Model. We’re going to compare the accuracy of the two classifiers because we believe we’ll find some good inferences from those models.
