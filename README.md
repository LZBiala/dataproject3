<b>Project goal:</b> Develop 3 classifiers to predict potential breast cancer using our dataset. 
Classifiers used were: 
<br>
-Deep Learning Model <br>
-Logistic Regression Model <br>
-Support Vector Machine Model 
<br>
We compared the accuracy of the three classifiers because we believe weâ€™ll find some good inferences from these models from our dataset.
